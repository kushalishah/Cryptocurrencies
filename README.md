# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of the project

Unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. I created an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data was not ideal, so I processed it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I was looking for, I has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. I used data visualizations to share my findings with the board.
